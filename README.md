## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will need Pyspark SQL and Pyspark ML.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.  


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

the goad is to predict churns based on user log data(a tiny subset (128MB) of the full dataset available (12GB)) from a music app.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files available in this repository:

* `Sparkify Project.ipynb` - a notebook of  Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering and Modeling to predict churns, and which is exported into `Sparkify Project.html`.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [blog post available here](https://medium.com/@happydanil/churn-prediction-with-pyspark-da6853630811).


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to the data from udacity,and thanks for all the instructions from udacity teams.
